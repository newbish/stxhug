The STxHUG is a community made up of Oracle EPM users, developers, partners, customers, and employees.  We are a user group run by users, for users.  Our group was founded in Sept 2017 and we are focused on sharing technical and business knowledge about EPM.  We are not affiliated with any particular firm, and we encourage Oracle customers, partners, and employees to join us.  Our meetings are a place where Hyperion users can network, share, learn, and socialize.  The dress code is casual, and all Hyperion related job functions and experience levels are welcome. 

The quarterly STxHUG meetings are organized by South Texas Hyperion users just like you..  

If you are interested in helping us plan meetings, let us know, we'd love to have you.   If you would like to host a meeting, sponsor social hour, or present at a meeting, let us know that as well!
